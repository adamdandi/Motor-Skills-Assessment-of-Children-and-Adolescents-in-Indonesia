**Project Title:** Motor Skills Assessment of Children and Adolescents in Indonesia

**Analysis Type:** Fundamental Motor Skills Assessment

**Tools Used:** Motor Competence Assessment (MCA) Instrument

**Completion Date:** October 14, 2023

**Company Industry:** Education

**Company Name:** Sebelas Maret University

**Overview Headline:** 
Validating and Assessing Motor Competence in Indonesian Youth

**Overview:** 
The project aimed to assess the validity and reliability of the Motor Competence Assessment (MCA) instrument for 12-year-olds in Indonesia. The study involved 680 participants from 19 elementary schools in diverse Indonesian elementary, middle, and high school backgrounds. Motor competence assessment involved six test components, each conducted with two trials. Its effectiveness in various contexts, including physical education and rehabilitation, supports targeted interventions. Understanding motor skill development with MCA enhances tailored approaches for individuals, promoting physical well-being and performance.

**Data Details:**
* Source: Motor Competence Assessment (MCA)
* Size: 680 participants, 19 schools
* Key Variables: 
    * Stability: Lateral Jumps, Shifting Platforms
    * Locomotor: Standing Long Jump, 10m Shuttle Run
    * Manipulative: Ball Kicking Velocity, Ball Throwing Velocity

**Problem Statement:** 
The project aimed to address the need for a valid and reliable instrument to measure fundamental motor skills in Indonesian children and adolescents.

**Solution:** 
The study employed the Motor Competence Assessment (MCA) instrument, which has been developed and validated across different age groups. The assessment was conducted in two trials for each of the six components. The data was then analyzed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to assess the validity of the instrument and Cronbach's alpha to determine its reliability.

**Insight:** 
The MCA instrument proved to be valid and reliable in measuring motor skills in the Indonesian context. The EFA identified two main components: locomotor skills and stability, and manipulative motor skills. This finding underscores the importance of mastering basic locomotor and stability skills before developing manipulative skills, which directly interact with surrounding objects.

**Recommendation:** 
The MCA instrument can be used as an effective tool for evaluating and promoting motor skill development among children and adolescents in Indonesia. It can be used in various contexts, including physical education, sports, and rehabilitation. By understanding the intricacies of motor skill development and having a reliable assessment tool like MCA, practitioners can better tailor interventions to meet the specific needs of individuals, ultimately promoting overall physical well-being and performance.
